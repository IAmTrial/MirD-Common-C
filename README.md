# Mir Drualga's Common for C (MDC)
This is a project containing commonly used features in various programs. Such features include convenient error handling and wide character conversion functions. Compatibility features are included in projects that target Visual Studio C++ 6.0 (VC6) and C89.

## Goal
MDC is intended to be a highly compatible generic library that can be used in projects targeting at minimum, Windows 95. At the very least, the project should be able to compile using VC6. Included features should be commonly used, and not be specific to a particular project.

## License
MDC is licensed under the Affero General Public License, version 3 or higher, with exceptions. If you would like to apply for a licensing exception, please contact Mir Drualga via the SlashDiablo Discord.
